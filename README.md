# Implementation_of_Regev_Factorisation
A qiskit implementation of regev's factorization algorithm for small N

This repo contains several notebooks :
  - ```Regev_implem.ipynb```: contains the main implementation for different small instances of the problem.
  - ```Find_lattice.ipynb```: contains tools to compute the exact expected dual lattices for a given instances of the problem.
  - ```QC_util.ipynb```: contains all sorts of utility functions for the other notebook.

It also contains a improved version of the [postprocessing code by Ekera](https://github.com/ekera/regevnum)
